# Markdown snippets for Leanpub in VSCode Editor

I've created these snippets for Leanpub authors to quickly insert blocks of Leanpub friendly markdown into book manuscript using VSCode editor.

## Installation and Usage

 1. Install Visual Studio Code 0.10.x or higher
 2. Launch Code
 3. From the command palette Ctrl-Shift-P (Windows, Linux) or Cmd-Shift-P (OSX)
 4. Select Install Extension
 5. Choose the extension
 6. Reload Visual Studio Code

Try out typing 'lp-tip' in any Markdown file and pressing 'Tab' key on your keyboard. You should get the following code generated for you:
```
T> ## 
T>
T> 
```
